This is my first hackathon project, and I have given it my 100% effort.
Throughout the hackathon, I focused on learning, problem-solving, and applying my skills creatively.
My goal was to build a project that is practical, innovative, and reflects my dedication to technology and teamwork.
I actively contributed in every part of the project, from planning and coding to testing and final presentation.
This project is not just a technical achievement for me, but a personal milestone showing my passion, commitment, and willingness to grow.
